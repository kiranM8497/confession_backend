 JS fundamentals down, what are closures, object prototype, event loop, etc.
  web fundamentals down, HTTP (headers, methods, cookie, body, status code), what is DNS, what is a CDN, how to do caching (and cache invalidation), OSI layers (probably don‚Äôt need to know too much, but you should be able to explain UDP/TCP vs HTTP).

If you‚Äôre doing full stack, SQL, architecture (load balancing, high availability)

 what is the difference between threading and concurrency?

 You gotta know a bit of everything, even tho nodejs is backend, they can plot twist you with a frontend type questions but at a high level:

Core concepts

how does the event loop work in node.js, and how is it different from the browser?

explain the difference between process.nexttick, setimmediate, and settimeout.

what are worker threads, and when would you use them?

how does node.js handle asynchronous operations under the hood?

explain how garbage collection works in node.js.

how do streams work in node.js, and when would you use them?

what is the purpose of the cluster module, and how does it handle scaling?

Performance and optimization

how would you handle a memory leak in a node.js application?

how do you optimize a high-throughput api built with node.js?

what are the trade-offs between child processes, worker threads, and clustering?

how would you monitor and profile a node.js application in production?

what are some ways to prevent blocking the event loop?

Security

how do you prevent prototype pollution in a node.js application?

what security risks does eval() pose in a node.js app?

how do you handle jwt authentication securely in a node.js backend?

how does csrf protection work in an api, and do you need it in a restful service?

what are the best practices for handling sensitive data (e.g., env variables, secrets management)?

Code challenges / hands-on exercises

implement a custom promise class from scratch.

write a function that limits the number of concurrent asynchronous tasks running at a time.

build a simple rate limiter middleware in express.

implement an lru cache using javascript.

create an async queue that processes tasks with a given concurrency limit.

Bonus Tips

Consider free and paid alternatives with a more structured approach to prepping for frontend interviews. Full disclosure, I am the creator of FrontendLead (dot) com, which offers a structured approach to preparing for front-end specific interviews at top tech companies, with company particular questions. (30-day money-back guarantee)

Use other platforms (free and paid) to also help you prepare.

Like solving a technical problem, you should always have multiple tools in your tool belt to solve a problem.

async/await v/s promises

Event loop concept

Callback Hell and remedying that

REST API, Middlewares, Swagger implementation(maybe)

Design Patterns for specific use cases, when to use what

SOLID principles (especially if it's typescript)

File structure for Express app, separation of logic

RESTful routes, how to add a filter to GET

Error handling

HTTP status codes 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500

Middleware

Authentication vs Authorization

ORM

Database normalization  
Code quality: readable, testable, good modularity and separation of concerns, and performance considerations.

Ability to adapt to changing requirements. How you respond when challenged about your choices.

Understanding of underlying concepts, using suitable language constructs, techniques and data structures.

Decision making skills. Did you consider different alternatives and evaluate the pros and cons? Do you understand the consequences of your decisions, and are you able to revisit earlier decisions in the presence of new information.

Resourcefulness. Are you able to get yourself unblocked? Do you ask the right questions, or know where/how to find the answers you need? Do you demonstrate debugging skills.

Problem solving skills. Do you break the problem down into smaller components? Do you ask the right questions to clarify requirements? Can you actually solve the problem?

Technical proficiency. Do you know what you‚Äôre talking about and can you clearly demonstrate your technical skills and knowledge?

Operational concerns. Do you understand the possible error cases and how to handle them? Have you considered security, reliability, performance, analytics and monitoring?
