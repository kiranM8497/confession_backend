the backend creates JWT with secret key,and sends jwt  to the client,
the client stores JWT(usually in the localstoratge)
 and includes JWT in the header with every request. the server validates the JWT
 with every request from client and sedns response.
so backend creates a token using using a encryption algorithm and shares thay token
with the client.
when the user makes makes request with the token creaeted by server, the server will 
decrypt the token and see if it comes from a valid user.
sensitive information should not be sored in the JWT.
the advantage of the token based authentication is that no extra database is used to store login data 
data like sessions
