user ===== <request> ==== server
request with username and password

server the verifies  credentials with DB ==> then creates a session for that user 
and store the sesion in the DB  and server sends a backa cookie to the client
cookie==> string of key value pairs.mianly the session id which was stored in the
 DB that will be sent to the user

 next time user makes the requests, cookie is sent along with request headers.
 server verifies  that cookie. checks if the session id matches with session stored 
 in th DB.then server sends 200OK response
 The drawback is that if we have millions of users , then backedn has to maintain 
 millions of sessions for all those users.
